okay
starting off we are above a caravan park
we are going to go due south straight south and then we're going to g-- turn straight back round and head north past an old mill on the right hand side
yeah
south and then straight back up again with an old mill on the right and you're going to pass on the left-hand side of the mill
okay
and then we're going to turn east
not straight east slightly sort of northeast
slightly slightly yeah
very slightly
and we're going to continue straight along erm quite a wee dis-- a wee distance erm quite a wee distance right we're going to continue along on that course
and then we're going to turn north again
and immediat-- well a distance below that turning point there's a fenced meadow
but you should be avoiding that by quite a distance
okay so we've turned and we're going up north again
continue straight up north
and then we're going to turn to the west on a curvature right sort of
"s" bend and immediately below that bend there is an abandoned cottage
and we're passing above the top of that
we're going to continue in that sort of "s" shape a big wide "s"
and on the sort of mmhmm top erm left of that again below it there's a fenced meadow
but you're passing on the top of that
okay
right okay
we've gone from the abandoned cottage right and we're on the sort of "s" shape yeah
right
and then at the top of the "s" we're turning north
okay
we're going straight due north
at the top there there's a west lake
which we're going to pass on the south erm southeast side
and we're going to do that in a curve almost a half "u" shape
yeah
yeah the southeast
and continue up north slightly
but not quite to the tip of that lake
and then we're going to turn down ove-- above a trig point and we're going to turn immediately to your right and straight down at an angle of forty-five
okay
and we're going to continue that wee distance down and that the point at the end of that it should be near to the abandoned cottage where we went past miles away but if not just carry on and then continue down in that forty-five degree
and turn round by a monument on the outside of the monument
yeah
and then a very slight turning up again north sort of northwest
very slight curve sort of very slight "s"-shaped just a slight curve and then going to proceed up north again
on the right-hand side there's a nuclear test site before right before reaching the top of that northbound
and then you're going to turn back west
and above that there's an east lake
yeah
and that's the finish
